# 📡 Reply Radar

**Reply Radar** is a playful, personal project built to help people keep track of the messages they still need to reply to — because we all know how easy it is to read something, get distracted and then forget to respond for days (or... weeks 👀).

This app exists for anyone who's ever said, “Oops, I meant to reply to that!” and wants to stay on top of conversations without guilt or chaos. No more ghosting your friends by accident. No more losing important messages in the middle of your busy day.

With Reply Radar, your forgotten replies are finally on the radar.  
A gentle nudge. A little order. A friendlier inbox — on your terms.

---

## ✨ What it does (for now)

- Basic **CRUD** for replies/messages
- Organize replies into three states:
  - **Active** – Messages still pending a reply
  - **Resolved** – Messages you've replied to and marked as done
  - **Archived** – Soft delete feature to hide messages you no longer want to see
- Clean and focused UI to help you stay on top of conversations

> ⚠️ **Reminders (and other cool features) aren't here yet** — but they're definitely on the radar. Stay tuned!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** – Shared logic across platforms
- **Jetpack Compose** – UI with modern declarative components
- **Room** – Local data persistence
- **Koin** – Lightweight dependency injection
- **MVI Architecture** – Unidirectional data flow for maintainable state handling
- **Coroutines + Flow** – For reactive and asynchronous operations

## 🧪 Current Status

This is still a work-in-progress — a personal playground to explore architecture patterns, Kotlin Multiplatform and UI ideas. It’s not production-ready, but it’s growing feature by feature.

## 🚫 Contributing

Currently a solo mission, but who knows? Contributions might be welcome in the future.
